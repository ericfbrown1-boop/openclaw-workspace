# PIPELINE.md — Code Pipeline, Completion Gates & Dashboard Rules
> **L1:** 4-phase workflow (Understand→Plan→Implement→Verify), task complexity gate, model tiering with costs, API budget gate, dual-write dashboard rule, test oracle references, E2E verification checklist.

## 🎯 Guiding Principle: CORRECTNESS OF OUTPUT (Standing Change 2026-03-28)

**Output correctness is the north star for the entire SDLC.** Every decision — planning, coding, testing, debugging — optimizes for one thing: the output the user receives must be correct, complete, and verifiable.

This means:
- **Testing proves output correctness**, not just "no errors." A pipeline that completes without errors but produces empty/wrong output has FAILED.
- **RCA is the core of all debugging.** When something breaks, don't fix the symptom — find the root cause, fix it permanently, document it so it never recurs.
- **Quality gates block bad output.** Gates log AND raise — never just log. A bad report must fail, not silently email garbage.
- **Retry only transient failures.** Rate limits and timeouts retry. Content quality failures do NOT retry — same input produces same bad output.
- **Silent fallbacks are bugs.** Every fallback to a default/placeholder is a logged WARNING. More than 3 fallbacks = pipeline FAILURE.

| Priority | Principle |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Output is correct** (content matches what was requested) |
| 2 | **Output is complete** (no missing sections, no placeholders) |
| 3 | **Failures are visible** (never silently succeed with bad output) |
| 4 | **Root causes are fixed** (not symptoms, not workarounds) |
| 5 | **Speed** (only after 1-4 are satisfied) |

## 4-Phase Workflow (MANDATORY for ALL task types)

Every task — code, research, audit, monitoring — follows these 4 phases:

```
Phase 1: UNDERSTAND → Phase 2: PLAN → Phase 3: IMPLEMENT → Phase 4: VERIFY
```

| Phase | What Happens | Who | Gate to Next Phase |
|-------|-------------|-----|-------------------|
| **1. UNDERSTAND** | Read codebase, gather requirements, identify constraints. "Explore First" rule. | Planner + Researcher | PROJECT_CONTEXT.md exists |
| **2. PLAN** | Design approach, decompose tasks, identify risks, set verification criteria. | Planner (+ Grok 4.20 Beta adversarial review) | PLAN.md approved by Jarvis |
| **3. IMPLEMENT** | Execute the plan. Write code, send reports, run analysis. Verify at each CHECKPOINT. | Coder / Researcher / Conductor | HANDOFF.md + git push |
| **4. VERIFY** | Test, review, audit, deploy. Multi-gate: Tester → Quality → Auditor → Conductor. | Tester + Quality + Auditor + Conductor | Completion gate passes (SHA or email ID in tasks.json) |

**Apply to ALL task types:**
- **Code tasks:** Understand codebase → Plan architecture → Implement code → Verify (tests + deploy)
- **Research tasks:** Understand question → Plan search strategy → Implement research → Verify findings (cross-check sources)
- **Error diagnosis:** Understand error context → Plan investigation → Implement fix → Verify fix works
- **Monitoring tasks:** Understand alert condition → Plan check → Implement sweep → Verify system healthy
- **Report tasks:** Understand requirements → Plan outline → Implement writing → Verify deliverable sent

## Hybrid Build Routing — macbook vs powerspec (Standing Change 2026-04-11)

`jarvis_pipeline.py` supports routing the Coder stage to PowerSpec via the `task.execution.coderHost` field. Use `"powerspec"` when:
- Build >15 min (frees Mac for interactive work)
- GPU required (RTX 5080)
- Windows-specific testing
- Large file IO (PowerSpec has faster NVMe)

Use `"local"` (default) when:
- Task is <5 min
- Depends on Mac-specific paths / tools (homebrew, launchd, Tailscale Serve)
- PowerSpec node is offline / unreachable

**Task schema extension:**
```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "execution": {
    "coderHost": "local" | "powerspec",
    "remoteWorkDir": "C:\\Users\\Eric Brown\\repos\\<task-id>",
    "remoteGitRepo": "https://github.com/..."
  }
}
```

The pipeline-state.json records `stages.coder.host` so audit trail shows which machine ran the work. Mission Control agentChain entries carry a `host` field per stage. See DELEGATION.md "Option C" section for full details and setup.

## Complete Code Pipeline (Detailed)

```
Phase 1: UNDERSTAND
  → Planner reads existing codebase ("Explore First" rule)
  → Researcher gathers requirements if needed
  → Output: PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

Phase 2: PLAN
  → Researcher gathers latest info on task domain (key success factors, pitfalls)
  → Planner (Opus 4.6) drafts PLAN.md informed by Research Brief
  → Grok 4.20 Beta adversarial review (challenges assumptions, finds gaps)
  → Jarvis merges Grok feedback into final PLAN.md
  → Output: Final PLAN.md (research-backed, dual-model reviewed)

Phase 3: IMPLEMENT
  → Coder implements (writes CHECKPOINT.md at each phase)
  → Coder verifies at each checkpoint (tests, Docker build, health check)
  → Output: HANDOFF.md + git push

Phase 4: VERIFY
  → Tester (import verification + test suite)
    → If FAIL: returns to Coder (Phase 3)
    → If PASS: HANDOFF.md for Quality
  → Quality (Security Audit + Code Review)
    → If CRITICAL: BFG cleanup, loop back to Phase 3
    → If CLEAN: proceed
  → External Auditor (6-step QA gate)
  → Conductor (Docker build + deploy + smoke tests)
  → Librarian (post-audit review, suggests improvements)
  → Code shipped ✅
```

## Global Completion Gate

No task may reach 100% / `completed` without BOTH:
1. **Code tasks:** `git push` succeeded + commit SHA in `tasks.json`
2. **Report tasks:** deliverable emailed + Gmail message ID in `tasks.json`

Enforced by Conductor, verified by External Auditor, monitored by Monitor.

## Task Complexity Gate (Anthropic: "only use multi-agent for high-value parallelizable tasks")

Before spawning ANY subagent, classify the task:

| Complexity | Time Est | Scope | Action |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|
| **SIMPLE** | < 5 min | Single file edit, quick fix | Jarvis does it directly. NO subagent. |
| **MODERATE** | 5-30 min | Multi-file, one concern | Single subagent with verification command |
| **COMPLEX** | > 30 min | Multi-step, parallelizable | Up to 3 concurrent subagents, each with plan |

**Ask before spawning:** "Could I do this in 2 minutes myself?" If yes → do it. Don't waste tokens on agent overhead.

**Token budget awareness:** Multi-agent uses ~15x more tokens than chat (per Anthropic). Only COMPLEX tasks justify the cost.

## Context Management Rules (Anthropic Best Practice)

**Cron payload limit:** No cron job message payload should exceed 500 tokens. Instead of embedding full instructions, have agents read their SKILL.md file for details. The cron message should be a brief trigger with a pointer to the skill.

**Isolated sessions:** Each pipeline stage runs in an isolated session (enforced by OpenClaw agent spawning). The main session orchestrates but does NOT execute heavy work. This prevents context bloat.

**Context hygiene:** When compaction warnings appear or context gets heavy, proactively save state to memory files and start fresh rather than dragging a massive conversation forward. Files survive sessions; context doesn't.

**Verification criteria:** Every task dispatch must include success criteria that the agent can verify programmatically (e.g., "tests pass", "curl /health returns 200", "lint clean"). Tasks without verification criteria are incomplete.

## Dashboard-as-Source-of-Truth Rule (DUAL WRITE)

**Two tasks.json files must stay in sync:**
1. `~/.openclaw/workspace/tasks.json` — OpenClaw agents read/write (source of truth)
2. `~/JarvisMissionControl/backend/data/tasks.json` — Mission Control dashboard reads

**Every agent** must update **BOTH** `tasks.json` files when:
- Task starts → `status: "running"` + `progress: 25`
- Milestone hit → increment `progress` (25 → 50 → 75)
- Task completes → `status: "completed"` + `progress: 100` (only after gate passes)
- Task fails/cancelled → `status: "failed"` + `error` field
- New task created → add immediately with `status: "queued"`

**New projects** appear on Task Board the moment they are requested.
**Monitor** verifies every 5 minutes; stale entries (>2h no update) trigger alert.
**Eric should never have to ask "status?"**

## API Budget Cost Gate (MANDATORY)

Before any Opus 4.6 task, check `memory/api-usage-state.json`:

| Budget Used | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| < 75% | Normal operations — use Model Tiering below |
| 75–90% | **Downgrade**: All non-critical tasks use Sonnet 4.6 (only Jarvis orchestration stays on Opus) |
| > 90% | **Pause**: Non-essential work stops. Alert Eric. Only critical fixes proceed (on Sonnet) |

Agents read `alert_level` from the state file:
- `"none"` or `"info"` → normal
- `"warning"` → downgrade to Sonnet
- `"critical"` → pause + alert

## Model Tiering Strategy

| Agent | Model | Context | Cost (in/out per M) | Rationale |
|-------|-------|---------|---------------------|-----------|
| Jarvis (main) | Opus 4.6 | 200K | $15 / $75 | Orchestration needs best reasoning |
| Planner (draft) | Opus 4.6 | 200K | $15 / $75 | Architecture needs depth; drafts PLAN.md from Research Brief |
| Researcher | Opus 4.6 | 200K | $15 / $75 | Depth + source-weighting for research briefs (updated 2026-04-11) |
| Planner (adversarial review) | Grok 4.20 Beta | 2M | ~$2 / $6 | Challenges plan assumptions, finds gaps, stress-tests for production readiness |
| Coder | Opus 4.6 | 200K | $15 / $75 | Correctness-first code synthesis; over-engineering caught by Quality (updated 2026-04-11) |
| Tester | Sonnet 4.6 | 200K | $3 / $15 | Test execution is deterministic |
| Quality | Grok 4.20 Beta | 2M | ~$2 / $6 | Adversarial output-correctness judgment — same reason Auditor uses Grok. Updated 2026-04-11. |
| Conductor | Sonnet 4.6 | 200K | $3 / $15 | Infrastructure tasks well-defined |
| External Auditor | Grok 4.20 Beta | 2M | ~$2 / $6 | Adversarial final-gate review; same model as Quality for consistency (updated 2026-04-13) |
| Librarian | Sonnet 4.6 | 200K | $3 / $15 | Analysis can use cheaper model |
| Monitor | Sonnet 4.6 | 200K | $3 / $15 | Simple monitoring tasks |

### Model Fallback Chain
If a primary model is unavailable (rate limit, outage, cooldown):
1. **Opus 4.6** → Grok 4.20 Beta → Sonnet 4.6 (used by main/researcher/planner/coder)
2. **Grok 4.20 Beta** → Opus 4.6 → Sonnet 4.6 (used by auditor/quality)
3. **Sonnet 4.6** → Grok 4.20 Beta → Opus 4.6 (used by tester/conductor/monitor fallback)
4. **Sonnet 4.6** → Grok 4.20 Beta (used by monitor/conductor — upgraded 2026-04-11 from grok-4)

## Test Oracle Schemas

Every task type has a formal verification schema in `skills/auditor/TEST_ORACLES.md`. Agents MUST:
1. **Planner**: Include the relevant oracle in PLAN.md `successCriteria`
2. **Coder/Researcher**: Self-check against oracle BEFORE writing HANDOFF.md
3. **Tester**: Validate oracle checks programmatically
4. **Monitor**: Verify completed tasks satisfy their oracle (Step 11: 4-Phase Compliance)

Available oracles: `task_completion`, `code_task`, `research_task`, `report_task`, `error_diagnosis`, `monitoring_sweep`, `earnings_analysis`, `competitive_intel`.

## E2E Verification Checklist

Before marking any pipeline run complete, verify:
1. **Agent health:** Each agent responds to a test prompt
2. **Delegation:** Keyword triggers route to correct agent (test each trigger)
3. **Pipeline flow:** Task flows Planner → Coder → Tester → Quality → Auditor → Conductor without stalling
4. **Completion gate:** tasks.json shows commit SHA and/or email ID
5. **Cron jobs:** All scheduled jobs show `lastStatus: "ok"` in `memory/cron-state.json`
6. **Fallbacks:** Simulate auth failure → verify fallback path activates

## Pre-Commit Quality Gate (MANDATORY)

**No code may be committed without passing ALL of these checks first.** This is a standing process change (2026-03-27).

### Checklist (run in order):

```
1. SYNTAX CHECK    node --check <file>  (for every new/modified .js/.ts file)
2. TEST SUITE      npm test  (or equivalent — must pass, zero failures)
3. LINT            eslint / ruff / shellcheck if configured (warnings OK, errors block)
4. SECRET SCAN     grep -r "sk-ant\|sk-proj\|ghp_\|API_KEY=" <new files>  (must be clean)
5. DRY RUN         Execute the primary code path once (e.g. --help, --dry-run, or a single-page test)
6. DIFF REVIEW     git diff --staged  — read what you're committing, verify no debug code or temp files
```

### Enforcement:

| Check | Blocks Commit? | Who Runs It |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Syntax check | ✅ Yes | Coder / Jarvis |
| Test suite | ✅ Yes | Coder / Quality |
| Lint | ⚠️ Errors only | Coder |
| Secret scan | ✅ Yes | Quality / pre-commit hook |
| Dry run | ✅ Yes | Coder |
| Diff review | ✅ Yes | Jarvis (before `git commit`) |

### Quick Command:

```bash
# Run all checks in one shot (Node.js projects)
for f in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.js$'); do node --check "$f" || exit 1; done \
  && npm test \
  && ! grep -r 'sk-ant\|sk-proj\|ghp_\|API_KEY=' $(git diff --cached --name-only) \
  && echo "✅ Quality gate passed — safe to commit"
```

**Origin:** Eric directive 2026-03-27 — "Make sure you apply Quality Agent before committing code"

## Docker Containerization Checklist (Standing Rule 2026-03-27)

**When moving standalone MacBook code into Docker/Railway:**

Before writing the Dockerfile, audit the standalone code for:
1. **CLI tools** — what binaries does it shell out to? (gog, gh, curl, etc.) → install in Dockerfile
2. **Auth tokens** — where are credentials stored? (Keychain, env, config files) → export and inject into container
3. **API keys** — what env vars does it read? → map to docker-compose environment or Railway vars
4. **Python packages** — what's imported? → requirements.txt must match
5. **System libraries** — any C extensions? (libpq, poppler, tesseract) → apt-get install
6. **File paths** — any hardcoded Mac paths? → containerize to /app/data/
7. **Network** — does it call localhost services? → use Docker service names

**Verify INSIDE the container** with `docker exec` before declaring it works.

**8. .env file** — NO inline comments (Docker Compose truncates at `#`). NO trailing whitespace. Validate on startup.
**9. Output quality** — after deploy, run E2E test: submit real request → wait → open output → verify real content (not defaults)
**10. Parser schemas** — if the app parses LLM JSON, each output schema has its own parser with correct fallback shape

**Origin:** Financial Report App — standalone used gog CLI + Keychain OAuth + Anthropic env var, none of which existed in the initial Docker image. Eric directive: "check what was done in the application and what's installed to see if you have the same compatibility inside the Docker container."

## 🔴 Output Quality Gate (Standing Change 2026-03-27)
**Origin:** FinancialReportApp — 3 reports emailed with "done" status but zero content. RCA: `memory/rca-financial-report-app.md`

### The Problem Class: "Silent Success"
A pipeline can complete every step (crawl ✅, API call ✅, save file ✅, send email ✅) while producing garbage output. This happens when:
1. An API key is truncated by env file parsing (Docker Compose `#` comment issue)
2. A data structure is nested wrong (dict inside dict instead of merged)
3. A JSON parser silently falls back to a default schema
4. Error handlers catch exceptions and return empty defaults instead of failing

### Prevention Rules (ALL agents, ALL pipelines):

**Rule 1: Validate Output Content, Not Just Status**
After EVERY deliverable is generated, open it and check:
```python
# For .docx reports:
doc = Document(output_path)
text = " ".join(p.text for p in doc.paragraphs)
assert len(text) > 500, "Report suspiciously short"
assert text.count("not available") < 3, "Report contains too many placeholder defaults"
assert text.count("not found") < 3, "Report contains too many missing-data markers"
```

**Rule 2: Fail Loud, Not Silent**
Every fallback/default MUST log WARNING. >3 defaults in one run = pipeline FAILURE.
```python
# BAD: silently return default
return data.get("executive_summary", "Analysis not available.")

# GOOD: log and count
value = data.get("executive_summary")
if not value:
    logger.warning("MISSING FIELD: executive_summary — using default")
    missing_count += 1
if missing_count > 3:
    raise ValueError(f"Too many missing fields ({missing_count}) — synthesis likely failed")
```

**Rule 3: Env Validation on Startup**
Every containerized app must validate env vars BEFORE processing requests:
```python
def validate_env():
    key = os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "")
    if not key.startswith("sk-ant-") or len(key) < 80:
        raise RuntimeError(f"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY invalid (length={len(key)}, prefix={key[:7]})")
    # Test connectivity
    resp = httpx.post("https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages", ...)
    if resp.status_code == 401:
        raise RuntimeError("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY fails authentication")
```

**Rule 4: Use Structured Outputs When Available**
For Claude API calls that need JSON, use `output_format` with Pydantic models instead of free-text JSON parsing:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from anthropic import Anthropic

class FinancialSynthesis(BaseModel):
    executive_summary: str
    quarterly_results: dict
    guidance: str
    # ... all required fields

response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    messages=[...],
    output_format=FinancialSynthesis,
)
# Guaranteed to match schema or raise an error — no silent fallbacks
```

**Rule 5: E2E Smoke Test Before Deploy**
No Docker app ships without an automated E2E test that:
1. Submits a real request
2. Waits for completion
3. Downloads the output artifact
4. Asserts content quality (not just existence)

### Output Parity Rule (Standing Change 2026-03-28)

**When an app delivers output through multiple channels (email, download, preview, API), ALL channels MUST serve the exact same content.**

This means:
1. **Generate once, serve many.** One file is generated and stored. Every channel reads from the same file path.
2. **Hash verification.** After generating the output file, compute SHA256 and store it. On download, recompute and verify the hash matches — reject if it doesn't.
3. **No re-generation.** Never re-render or re-generate on download. The download endpoint serves the file as-is.
4. **No caching surprises.** Set `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store` and `ETag` on download responses to prevent stale cached versions.
5. **Audit trail.** Log the hash at generation time and verify it at download time. If they diverge, log an INTEGRITY VIOLATION.

**Implementation pattern:**
```python
# At generation time:
hash = sha256(file_bytes).hexdigest()
db.store(file_hash=hash)

# At download time:
current_hash = sha256(read_file()).hexdigest()
assert current_hash == db.file_hash, "INTEGRITY VIOLATION"
response.headers["ETag"] = hash
response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store"
```

**Origin:** Eric directive 2026-03-28 — emailed report had full content, browser download had different/stale content.

### Docker .env File Rules (Permanent)
- **NEVER** use inline comments in `.env` files (`KEY=value # comment` → KEY gets truncated)
- **NEVER** use quotes around values unless they contain spaces
- Keep `.env` files as `KEY=value` only, one per line
- Validate env vars on container startup (prefix, length, connectivity)
- This is a well-documented Docker Compose issue: docker/compose#9025, #9327, #9509

### LLM Response Parsing Rules (Permanent)
- **Prefer structured outputs** (Anthropic `output_format`, OpenAI JSON mode) over free-text parsing
- If free-text parsing is required, each schema gets its OWN parser with schema-appropriate fallbacks
- Never share a parser between components expecting different JSON shapes
- When a parser fails, preserve the raw response for debugging (`_rawResponse`)
- Add recovery logic that re-parses `_rawResponse` before giving up

---

## 🏆 Coding Quality Standard (Standing Rule — 2026-04-13)

**Always seek the highest quality solution. Complete projects successfully with minimum interruptions to Eric. Never give up.**

### When a coding task hits a blocker:
1. **Try to fix it yourself first** — read docs, check logs, search for the exact error
2. **Spawn the right specialist** — Coder, Auditor, RCA Agent, Researcher. Pipeline exists; use it.
3. **Pivot, don't quit** — if one approach fails, try another. Report the pivot, not the failure.
4. **Only interrupt Eric if:** real money at stake, external comms going out, genuinely ambiguous requirements, or security-critical decision.

### Persistence hierarchy (exhaust in order before asking Eric):
1. Fix it yourself
2. Spawn Coder agent
3. Spawn Auditor for RCA
4. Spawn RCA Agent + Auditor dual-RCA
5. Research via Researcher agent
6. Try alternative implementation approach
7. **Only then:** ask Eric — but include what you tried and what the specific blocker is

**Origin:** Eric directive 2026-04-13
